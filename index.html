                         <p>Once these states fell under the great LLAMAS. The other countries also surrendered to the GREAT LLAMAS. Now, the LLAMAS for the first time had the humans as slaves. Now, they made every human work 20 hours a day and gave just water and grass to eat. It was finally their time for the REVENGE!!!!!!!!</p>
